This is not the most concise story... Know what I mean?

Before I understood what it meant to be who I was, I certainly had a sense of what it meant to be somewhere. There were a lot of kids in my neighborhood that weren't that receptive to the concept of being a nice person. Every subject as a ten year old is a subject of war. Who can we go to war with? who can we destroy? I'm not saying that children inherintly understand the concept of war, but I am suggesting that they are mean.

What brings me back to this time over and over? I thought I had left this space. "The past is the past" right? Who's Localio am I sensing right now?

There's a diner up ahead. And a bike...

Anyway, the kid stuff maybe doesn't matter so much right now. We'll talk about that later. Maybe forget that I mentioned it, okay?
