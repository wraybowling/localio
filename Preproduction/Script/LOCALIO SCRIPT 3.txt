LOCALIO SCRIPT 3

There. I'm almost finished. There won't be much work left for me now. I've been in the zone for hours. I've been visualizing the finish, and it's working. All that time was worth it. The lies were worth it! Hell. Just how much longer should I run for?

. . .

(A blue tower suddenly became visible. The paint looked worn, and its shape much like an obelisk. It must've been put up for cellphones or something, but it looked too old.)

: Just five more minutes.
: Just a little bit more!
: It's all about muscle memory.

There!

(Theo was looping. This wasn't the first time it had happened, either. He was never sure how to make these loops end. They would go on and on like this, meanwhile the loops get shorter. As they get shorter, there's less time to prepare for when they jump-cut.)

(A blue tower suddenly becomes visible. It looks worn, and familiar.)

: Just one more time
: I'll definitely reach the tower
: i just want to climb up it...

(One way Theo knew how to end the loops was to look around to figure out where he was. Where is this?)

: I'm riding a bus or car or something @1
: i'm out for a walk @2
: I've never been here before. @3

1. Right. i'm asleep on the train. There is no tower. It's a dream.

(Turn your phone to look around the train)

two girls : “did you invite him? ... did you really like him? ... oh. ... not really a situation to be in. maybe he didn't.”

two girls : “just go and watch the fish! lol My friends were abandoned! lol”

two girls : “are you going to answer your phone? ... alright. where's the stall? i need the toilet.” (she leaves)



2. right. I'm out for a walk
