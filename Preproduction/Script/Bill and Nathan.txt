Localio--Chapter 1--Origins

--Scene opens on two young boys, standing in driveway--

NATHAN: So, what was your name again?

YOU: [Insert Name] (Bill). And you're Nathaniel, right?

NATHAN: Right, but my friends just call me Nathan. Glad to know you, Bill. I think you're going to like Localio. Sometimes it can be a little dull, but if  you stick with meyou'll fit in just fine. I only moved here myself last year. 

BILL: So have you lived in this house since you moved here?

NATHAN: Yep. My parents and I used to live in an apartment in Seattle, but this has a much bigger backyard.

**New Location added: Nathaniel's House**

BILL: How big, exactly?

NATHAN: Why don't we go find out? It looks like our parents are still talking in the kitchen.

BILL: Er, I guess? Shouldn't we tell them where we're going?

NATHAN: We'll be back before they even notice. Do you want to go or not?

## New choice: Yes / No ##  Yes= BILL a/NATHAN a No=BILL b/NATHAN b

LABEL B

BILL b: Maybe we should save that for another time.

NATHAN b: Fine by me--I'm always up for exploring though, just let me know when you're ready.  

##Cut to--choice sequence ending##

OR 

BILL a: Let's do it.

NATHAN a: Awesome, let's head out. 

--Boys head behind house into adjacent forest--

** New location added: Woods**

BILL a: Wow, you really live right in the woods, huh?

NATHAN a: Yep. You got a problem with that?

BILL a: Sorry, no,  I didn't mean to...

NATHAN a: (laughs) I'm just kiddin' you, man. The first time I ever came out here I was a little overwhelmed, too. A forest looks a lot different from a city.

BILL a: No kidding.

NATHAN a: A city is much brighter, more organized, and with a lot more open space. There's something about the woods that I like a lot more though.

BILL a: How do you mean?

NATHAN a: Well, it's not something that's always easy to explai...

--Animation, Nathan trips over what appears to be a large rock--

BILL a: Whoa! Are you ok??

NATHAN a: (brushing himself off) Ha, I'll be fine. Who the heck left that stupid rock in the path?

BILL a: (moving over to the rock) Yeah, that's really...hey, wait a second. This isn't a rock at all.

NATHAN a: What??

BILL a: It's a...shell?

NATHAN a: A turtle shell? Wow, I've never seen one of those out here before. But, where's the turtle?

BILL a: Gone, by the look of it. Maybe he traded in for a newer model.

NATHAN a: In that case, we should keep it.

BILL a: You think?

NATHAN a: Hey, he doesn't seem to need it anymore. But Let's head back before our parents start to wonder where we ran off to.

**New item: turtle shell (do we have items?)

##Choice sequence ended##

NATHAN: Well, it looks like our parents are just wrapping up.

BILL: Yeah, looks like it. So...I'll see you at school tomorrow?

NATHAN: You bet. You look nervous. Don't worry--it's just school. You'll do ok.

BILL: It's not the school part I'm worried about, but thanks, Nathan. See you later.

MOM: Alright Bill, let's go home. 

--Scene change, transition animation. Arrive home--

MOM: Well, here we are.

BILL: I wish we still lived at our old house.

MOM: Bill, honey, we've been over this and over this. This is our home now, so you'd better start getting used to it.

**New Location added: Home**
